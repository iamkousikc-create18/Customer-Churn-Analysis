# Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
The objective is to understand churn patterns, perform customer segmentation, and build machine learning models to predict customer churn.

---

## Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Target variable: `Churn`

---

## Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Data Preparation
- Removed non-informative features
- Handled data type inconsistencies
- Prepared data for analysis and modeling

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed numerical and categorical features
- Identified churn patterns using visualizations
- Observed class imbalance in the target variable

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation
- Segmented customers based on behavioral and service-related attributes
- Identified distinct customer groups with varying churn tendencies

### Task 4: Churn Prediction Model
- Built multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
- Evaluated model performance using standard metrics

### Task 5: Model Evaluation and Interpretation
- Evaluated models using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC–AUC score
- Interpreted model results to understand churn prediction behavior
